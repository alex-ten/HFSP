title: Free play raster plots
category: closed_loop
entrynum: 1
---

Perhaps the following raster plots are not readily interpretable, but bing the most literal representation of the raw free play data available, they might inspire some ideas. [Figure 1](#f-1) shows a raster plot for each group / condition split. Each row is a separate subject in that group. The x-axis represents consequtive trials of free play, vertical marks represent *errors* and black diamons represent switch trials (i.e. trials after which a subject switched to a different task). You can use the button in the notes to the figure to view the same plots with an alternative coloring scheme such that each task is a distinct color.

**Notes** (use this button to change colors [ðŸŽ¨](){: .switch})
- Unsurprisingly, sequences of 2D and R tasks seem to be more dense (with errors) than sequences of 1D and I1D.
- Some participants (especially in the F/i- group) stick to the 1D task despite committing very few errors
