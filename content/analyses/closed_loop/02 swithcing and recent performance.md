[Figure 2.1](#f-2-1){: .animated} shows proportions of time spent on each task and switches to each task in the two groups. This visualization demonstrates that the two groups made similar decisions when it came to *choosing* a task given a decision to switch. However, decisions about *when* to switch seems to be different across groups. The free group spent most of its time on task 1D, yet switched to it the least. Both groups switched to the R task the most, but the strategic group spent almost 40% of time on that task. From the learning progress hypothesis perspective it might seem like the strategic group failed to follow an optimal learning strategy, but bear in mind that the ultimate mastery of tasks was similar across groups, and that becoming certain about uncertainty of an event as also a learning progress. And if the process of growing certain about an uncertainty of an event takes longer, perhaps the strategic group were optimal. This could explain the prevalence of R-task trials among subjects who were explicitly informed (see figure [Figure 2.2](#f-2-2){: .animated}) about the unsolvability of one of the tasks.
