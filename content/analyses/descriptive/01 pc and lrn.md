To ascertain that the task works as intended we tested the performance during the training stage: the first 60 trials that each person received, in which they played with each family for 15 trials, receiving feedback on each trial. 

As intended, performance (PC):
- declines in order from 1D, I1D, 2D, R tasks
- is not affected by group or instruction (next slide, left column)

At the end of the training stage, each person provided a “learnability” rating for each task (which we call LRN) on a scale of 1 to 10 (lowest to highest learnability; see [Materials]({{site.baseurl}}/content/materials/materials.md)).

The LRN ratings were:
- negatively correlated with PC for all tasks 
- not affected by group or instruction
- highest for the R task
