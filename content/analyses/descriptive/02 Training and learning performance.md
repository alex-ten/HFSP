[Figure 2](#f-2) shows the **PC** during the *last 5 trials* of training plotted against **delta PC** (**dPC**; the difference between PC and percent correct over the *last 10 trials* of testing or free exploration, depending on the group)
- Most of the subjects who did poorly (PC <= .6) during training on 1D improved, and those who did better during training either did equally well on the test, or slightly worse.
- In contrast, on I1D and 2D, more of those who did poorly initially did not improve and a lot of those who did well in the beginning, got worse (especially on 2D).

#### Notes
- Additional filtering of subjects who played only up to 10 trials in the F group was applied and resulted in the removal of 41 more subjects. Thus, [Figure 2](#f-2) depicts data from 289 subjects: 57, 56, 84, 92 in groups F/i-, F/i+, S/i- and S/i+, respectively.
- The mean plots show the average values across the three learnable tasks (1D, I1D, and 2D).
