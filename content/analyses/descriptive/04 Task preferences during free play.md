### 4.1. Distributions of %selection across individuals

To verify that the patterns in [Figure 2.3 ](#f-2-3){: .animated} are expressed at the individual levels, we plotted the distributions of %selection, across individuals for the F and S groups. This is shown in [Figure 4.1.1](#f-4-1-1){: .animated}.

#### Notes
- There is a range of individual preferences in the extent of self-challenge
- This figure shows the expected differences (R task is selected more by the S than the F group, 1D task shows the opposite pattern, 2D and I1D differ much less)
- The preferences are not due to a few outlier individuals but reflect the entire sample
- There is wide variability in the task preferences: F people select the 1D task anywhere from 10% to 90% of the time, S people select the R task anywhere from 10% to 90% of the time; the distributions are fairly flat, indicating a variety of individual strategies

In [Figure 4.1.1](#f-4-1-1){: .animated} I attempted to convey the same sort of information as in [Figure 4.1.1](#f-4-1-1){: .animated} in a slightly different form. Individuals are represented as a 4-sided polygon filled with a very feint color, so only consistent group-level patterns are noticeable. The closer a corner of an individual polygon to the edge of the radar plot, the more time they spent on the task during free play. Not particularly informative beyond what we have seen so far, but pretty.

### 4.2. Predictors of free-play stage task preferences

[Figure 4.2](#f-4-2){: .animated} shows how the proportion of time spent on each task during the free-play period relates to performance on other tasks during that period.

#### Notes
- %correct is PC during the free-play stage.
- For the 3 learnable tasks, %selection tends to be positively correlated with PC for the F group, but negatively correlated for the S group: consistent with the S group challenging themselves more.
- The %selection of the 1D task is negatively correlated with PC on the I1D and 2D tasks (both F and S groups).
- %selection of the R task is positive correlated with PC on the 1D and 2D tasks (both F and S groups).

So, there is a general negative correlation between play stage PC and 1D preference, and positive correlation between PC and R preference (top row of each grid). However, **the interpretation is ambiguous**. Two candidate explanations were proposed:
1. *Fast learners challenge themselves more*. Thus, people who learn I1D and 2D during training or in the beginning of free play challenge themselves by playing the R task more.
2. *Self-challengers learn faster*. More driven people take on more difficult tasks and learn them faster as a result.

The ambiguity lies in the cause of variability in initial learning. Are some people more lucky or are they more driven?
