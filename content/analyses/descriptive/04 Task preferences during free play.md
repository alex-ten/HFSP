### 4.1. Distributions of %selection across individuals

To verify that the patterns in [Figure 2.3 ](#f-2-3){: .animated} are expressed at the individual levels, we plotted the distributions of %selection, across individuals for the F and S groups. This is shown in [Figure 4.1.1](#f-4-1-1){: .animated}.

#### Notes
- There is a range of individual preferences in the extent of self-challenge
- This figure shows the expected differences (R task is selected more by the S than the F group, 1D task shows the opposite pattern, 2D and I1D differ much less)
- The preferences are not due to a few outlier individuals but reflect the entire sample
- There is wide variability in the task preferences: F people select the 1D task anywhere from 10% to 90% of the time, S people select the R task anywhere from 10% to 90% of the time; the distributions are fairly flat, indicating a variety of individual strategies

In [Figure 4.1.1](#f-4-1-1){: .animated} I attempted to convey the same sort of information as in [Figure 4.1.1](#f-4-1-1){: .animated} in a slightly different form. Individuals are represented as a 4-sided polygon filled with a very feint color, so only consistent group-level patterns are noticeable. The closer a corner of an individual polygon to the edge of the radar plot, the more time they spent on the task during free play. Not particularly informative beyond what we have seen so far, but pretty.
