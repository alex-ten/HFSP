<p>
    Analyses are divided into four sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the data. Note, that the analyses and visualizations in all sections except <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/content/analyses/Outliers">[Outliers]</a> were performed with clean data that excluded the outliers.

<ul>
    {% for section in site.data.anal_sections %}
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/content/analyses/{{section.folder}}/index.html">
            {{section.title}}
        </a>
        {% include anal_nav.html category=section.folder %}

    {% endfor %}
