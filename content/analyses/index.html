<p>
    Analyses are divided into four sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the data. Note, that the analyses and visualizations in all sections, except the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/content/analyses/Outliers" class='animated'>Outliers</a> section, were performed with clean data that excluded the outliers.
</p>

<ul>
    {% for section in site.data.anal_sections %}
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/content/analyses/{{section.folder}}/index.html" class='animated'>{{section.title}}</a>
    </li>
    {% include entries-list.html category=section.folder %}

    {% endfor %}
</ul>
