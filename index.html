<h1>Home</h1>

<p>
    The purpose of this website is to privately share ongoing research analyses and ideas from the active sampling study. The Analyses section contains various sections devoted to different aspects of data from the experiment. In Materials, you will be able to find the details of stimuli and procedures used in our experiment. The Writeup section contains a more coherent story of what we think the data is telling us.
